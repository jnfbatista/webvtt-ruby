00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
(light music)
(icons boinging)

00:00:03 --> 00:00:05.580
- So in a world of electric
cars, in this video,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.310
we're gonna be taking a
look at a $20,000 hybrid,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.050
a $120,000 hybrid, and
a $2 million hybrid car.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.460
So this video is part an explainer,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.950
part a chance to drive
some really sick cars.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.020
Shout out to Triple F
Collection, we'll get there.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.090
Anyway, unless you guys have
been living under a rock,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.040
you've seen that electric
cars have been having

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.270
a bit of a renaissance lately,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.840
surging in popularity till
the number one best sold

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.640
new car on earth is electric,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.390
but they are still very
much a new technology.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.550
Like they're obviously
awesome with instant torque

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.250
and no emissions and fast acceleration,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.800
but they have these huge, heavy batteries

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.330
and they take forever to recharge

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.560
and there's not enough infrastructure

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.110
for everyone to own them,
so there's this window now

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.530
where it makes a lot of sense
that maybe for most people,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.220
a hybrid is actually the best option.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.053
Interesting.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:04.111
(upbeat music)

00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:11.460
(upbeat music continues)

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.680
So I don't think anyone's
buying the Corolla

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.840
for speed or power.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.830
I mean, if I'm being honest,

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.660
it's actually still pretty zippy.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.590
So this car starts at $24,000

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.150
and it's a hybrid purely,
purely for efficiency.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.890
So the basics of this hybrid system,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.510
and many others in the same class,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.540
is that the wheels can be
driven by the gas engine

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.910
or the electric motor, or both.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.880
So this Corolla hybrid
has a 1.8 liter engine

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.130
and one electric motor at the front axle

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.370
that deliver a combined 138 horsepower

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.990
and it's powering the electric motor

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.470
with a pretty small 1.6
kilowatt hour battery.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.780
So at low speeds, you've
probably been in a car like this,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.260
the car goes totally electric,
the gas engine turns off,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.970
but once you go over a certain speed,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.290
or use a certain amount of power,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.330
then it's gonna fire
up the gas engine again

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.130
and it couples it with the electric motor.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.350
Then anytime you're braking or coasting,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.720
that's when it charges
the battery back up.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.160
It's as you're slowing down,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.660
it captures some of that energy,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.730
so it never actually
needs to be plugged in

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.500
to charge up that small battery,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.400
and this system is good for
literally 50 miles per gallon.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.270
When you drive this car, you
literally have a game score,

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.010
an eco score as you drive
of if you can slow down

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.050
and roll onto your accelerations better

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.050
and roll to a stop more easily,
you can gamify efficiency

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.090
in this car to get your
maximum miles per gallon.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.170
So it actually divides it up.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.180
I have my eco zone, so I'm driving

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.190
and if I get my little
bar in the eco zone,

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.540
I'm doing a good job.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.780
And then I have starts, cruises and stops.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.360
I've gotten my eco score
pretty high, not to brag,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.330
but I've seen it in the
70s, which is pretty sick.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.010
I don't know what happens
when I get to 100,

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.950
but what I do know is the
better I get that score,

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.360
the more miles per gallon I get.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.310
But yeah, pretty much everything
about the rest of this car

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.650
is designed around that efficiency.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.470
It's aerodynamic enough that
it slips through the air.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.260
It's got tires that have
a low rolling resistance.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.390
It doesn't have these
like sticky grippy tires.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.390
That's actually against
efficiency, in this case.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.010
So if you're looking
for a reason why someone

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.810
would buy a hybrid today,

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.070
it's because they're not trying

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.430
to charge a huge battery
every night in their garage

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.420
or rely on the grid or rely
on finding public chargers.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.760
It's 'cause they just
want better gas mileage

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.760
and they wanna spend less, not
zero, but less on gas today.

00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:33.510
(car dinging)

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.570
But you already know,
these cars are obviously

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.950
very utility focused.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.490
They're for people who just
are going places, right?

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.930
But what if you're more after
the ultimate driving machine,

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.730
something a little more versatile?

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.380
Then you can spend a little more money

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.123
and get something like this.

00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:54.844
(beat music)

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.210
All right, so this car
starts at about $100,000,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.800
a little over, and this car
is a hybrid for versatility.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.950
So the idea is this is a BMW 750e.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.860
There's a bunch of vehicles in this class,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.290
but yeah, you've spent enough
money now at this point

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.150
that you can reap the benefits
of both gas and electric.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.880
So this hybrid system
has a bit more hardware

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.710
to accomplish two different goals,

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.870
so there's a three liter
straight six engine

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.490
making around 300 horsepower,

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.380
and a medium sized 14.4
kilowatt hour larger battery,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.260
powering a roughly 200
horsepower electric motor,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.660
so you're totaling around 500 horsepower.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.710
So once again, it can drive
using both gas and electric,

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.670
just like the Toyota,

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.920
but now there's enough battery capacity

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.100
that you can also drive fully electric

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.800
at totally normal everyday driving speeds

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.200
up to like 30 miles on a charge

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.880
without ever turning on the gas engine,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.120
and then also, unlike the
Corolla, this is a plug-in hybrid

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.400
so you can directly
plug the car into a wall

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.280
to replenish the battery
and just keep driving around

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.670
on electric as long as you
want to with zero gas use,

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.010
so it does everything in
the Toyota does, but more.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.530
I do feel like plug-in
hybrids at this moment in time

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.680
are the one that make the most sense

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.470
for the most people that I see driving 'em

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.910
'cause if you have a short commute,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.670
let's say you have a 10
mile commute every day

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.460
and you just plug in at a charger at work

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.470
or in your garage every night

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.390
or during work in the daytime,

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.300
you can just straight up
never pay for gas again

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.460
and drive it just like an electric car,

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.680
but on the off chance you
do need to drive further,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.200
go for a road trip, or
just do something more

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.000
than your normal 10 mile commute,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.280
you have all the benefits of a gas car.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.370
Thankfully these hybrids
also have one crucial piece

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.850
of the electric car, which
is regenerative braking,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.560
which means it's gonna
be able to recuperate

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.020
a lot of the energy once
I've gotten up to speed

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.840
and start filling up the
battery as I'm driving.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.420
So there's a little graph on
the dash you can see here,

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.280
which means as I accelerate

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.680
and I take energy out of
the battery, it goes up,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.350
but as I decelerate,
it's actually blending

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.080
and friction braking with
regenerative braking,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.760
and if I drive around
like this long enough,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.890
especially if I go down
hills and break a lot,

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.530
I will actually start adding to the charge

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:17.910
of this battery too.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.460
But you know how electric cars
also have that party trick

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.783
of instant torque available
at any RPM and any speed?

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.440
Well, the hybrid should benefit
a little bit from that too.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.660
So because this motor is powerful enough

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.330
and the battery is big enough
to provide the voltage,

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.120
yes, in the sportiest mode, this car also,

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.490
when you floor it, gets that initial hit

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.640
from the electricity and
then follows with the surge

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.250
of the rest of the power
from the gas engine.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.630
Oh, and one of the things I say a lot

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.730
on the Auto Focus channel,
or I've said before,

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.400
is there are certain types of cars

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.710
that are best to go electric,

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.130
and because of how much batteries weigh,

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.840
cars that are already heavy

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.430
are the best ones to go electric.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.920
So like this is a big
four-door luxury sedan.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.740
There is no attempt on
making this a small car.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.030
It's huge, it's got lots of
space, it's soft, it's cushy.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.310
This is a great type
of car to go electric,

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.710
which is why the i7 is good,

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.810
but yeah, there are lots
of other versions of this.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.320
The RAV4 hybrid, the
Toyota Prius Prime hybrid,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.180
all sorts of other plug-in hybrids.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.210
Yeah, if I were to recommend
one version for more people,

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.030
like this, you still get all
the nice plushy suspension

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.210
and all of the tech in the
car and all the screens

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.510
and the way it drives,
it's the same thing,

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.430
but more accessible.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.680
You don't have to have
a plug in your garage.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.440
So all that is fun.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.390
That's, I get it. It's versatile.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.990
This is why they call it the
ultimate driving machine,

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.370
but you can always spend more.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.050
You can always spend more.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:54.050
And when you do, you end up in
the territory of specialists

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.333
and this is definitely a specialist.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.837
Just give me a second.

00:07:59.837 --> 00:08:02.504
(door whirring)

00:08:05.647 --> 00:08:08.340
Hold on a second, just wanna...

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.173
Okay.

00:08:10.663 --> 00:08:11.613
Now close that.

00:08:14.003 --> 00:08:16.503
(jazzy music)

00:08:19.694 --> 00:08:24.694
♪ I've just got eyes for you ♪

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.486
♪ No other could enchant me ♪

00:08:28.486 --> 00:08:31.183
♪ Darlin' like you do ♪

00:08:31.183 --> 00:08:35.516
♪ 'Cause I've just got eyes for you ♪

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.057
- So this car costs $2.5 million

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:48.990
and it's a hybrid purely for performance,

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.600
which I mean, you could probably
tell just by looking at it,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.490
but also by the fact that I'm sitting

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.620
in the middle of the car now.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.873
I have to get used to this.

00:08:57.873 --> 00:09:00.780
This is the McLaren Speedtail.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.490
So McLaren's done this a few times.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.260
One center driver's seat,
two passenger seats,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.050
and just a whole lot of calibration for me

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.570
for this insane driving position.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.340
But yeah, this thing is a hybrid.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.750
It's technically a hybrid.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.720
So this hybrid system is pretty crazy.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.900
It's very focused on
literally just going as fast

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.930
as physically possible, which
is just about maximizing power

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.040
and minimizing weight.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.380
So there's already a twin turbo

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.310
four liter V8 engine pushing
out 750 plus horsepower,

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.700
but then they've also
designed a special small,

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.300
but super high-powered
1.6 kilowatt hour battery

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.090
that powers a single
electric motor by itself

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.600
that generates an extra
300 more horsepower.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.240
So the total is now over 1,000 horsepower

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.180
and that motor is
basically just being used

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.510
to help spin the wheels
even faster than the engine

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.590
by itself could.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.120
There is no electric-only mode.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.120
There is no situation where
the gas engine ever shuts off.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.830
There are no efficiency goals here.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.510
This is actually really similar

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.790
to the turbocharged hybrid
setups you literally see

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.050
in Formula 1 today.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.340
It's just about going fast.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.650
So here's a couple of those
hilariously over-engineered

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:11.640
pieces of this car.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.280
First of all, this is the only
car I've ever actually driven

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.370
that's shipped with cameras
instead of side view mirrors,

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.530
for even better aerodynamics, of course.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.900
They've also got the
electrochromic glass roof tint

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.140
and windshield tint instead
of moving fabric pieces.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.410
But then also, the active
arrow on the back of this car

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.600
is not just like regular pivoting parts

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.220
or spoilers or anything like that,

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.910
but it's literally bending
the carbon fiber body work,

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.060
and all of the paint and coatings with it

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.400
up and down when you're under braking

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.170
to assist with slowing down.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.210
That's insane if you can
see what's happening here.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.100
And this is also the
only car I've ever seen

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.270
with a wireless charger.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.970
That's right, the McLaren
Speedtail wireless charges,

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.860
so the battery is at the bottom of the car

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.500
and it's small enough that
if the driver doesn't park

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.080
exactly over the right
spot in their garage,

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.880
it's not a huge deal because, again,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.620
it's a small battery, it
shouldn't take too long

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.750
and inductive charging has
never been particularly

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.520
efficient, but it'll eventually work.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.470
And no, I don't think that this would fly

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.540
for any fully electric car today.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.970
Everything about the outside
of this car is designed,

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.497
it's sculpted to just cut through the air

00:11:14.497 --> 00:11:18.510
and that's how it does
zero to 186 miles an hour

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.490
faster than a Bugatti Chiron,

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.610
and 250 miles an hour in a straight line.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.050
Now, I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:29.100
about these super, super
fast electric cars.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.080
They need a huge battery

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.210
to realistically make that happen, right?

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.670
Let's take Tesla Model
S Plaid, for example.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.450
1,000 horsepower, crazy high
power output from the battery,

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.670
but in order to do that, they
need to give it this huge

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.990
100 kilowatt hour battery

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.000
so that when you export all that power,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.800
you don't just drain the
battery super quickly,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.110
you can keep driving like a normal person.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.320
So that's why you have
these super high horsepower

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.600
electric cars, but they always come

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.430
with the sacrifice of weight.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.300
They're always heavy.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.790
The Lucid Air, it's fighting its weight.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.240
The EV6 GT, it's fighting how heavy it is.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.400
With a supercar like this,

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.710
it's not fully electric all the time

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.380
and so they're willing
to put in a tiny battery

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.330
that exports a ton of power

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.080
and basically drains it in seconds.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.210
So I'm gonna show you
something with this real quick.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.180
Right now I have 100% of my battery.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.490
I'm gonna do just a quick little pull

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.220
and see just what a couple of seconds

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.653
of electric-assisted acceleration will do.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.570
(engine revving)

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.670
Way down to 74% battery,

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:46.500
just from that little
acceleration, 100 to 74,

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.333
and now it's already,

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:48.990
it's going right back up to 100.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.940
It's almost 100 again because I'm driving

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.390
and recuperating that
energy and now it's 100.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.740
This is super high-tech stuff

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.200
and it actually has a lot of parallels

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.270
to what we see in Formula 1.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.040
Believe it or not, those Formula 1 cars

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.690
that we're watching on TV today,

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:08.070
those are small turbocharged
hybrid powertrains.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:09.770
I kind of wanna do that again.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.520
(engine revving)

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.710
That's what the F1 cars
are doing out there.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.890
They are recovering energy as they break,

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.980
and they are spending
energy when they accelerate.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.480
And I guess that's the
difference between this

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.530
and the Rimac Nevera.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.020
You remember, you probably
have seen the video I did

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.820
with the quickest
electric car in the world,

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.570
the Rimac Nevera, which yes,
does have a big heavy battery.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.990
It weighs like 5,000
pounds like a Model S.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.150
The crazy thing about that
car, and that's an anomaly,

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.680
is that it has four electric motors,

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.410
which you can kind of think of
as being treated like gears,

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.610
but not really.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.170
This will have a higher top speed

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.870
simply because it just keeps gearing up,

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.530
seven speed gearbox, and it
pulls all the way through

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.810
up to 250 miles an hour.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.180
If you want a hybrid supercar,

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.980
you can kind of have both fast
and quick in the same car.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.300
This is fast and quick.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.500
I mean, it's not razor
sharp, fully electric quick,

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.080
but it's close and it's,
yeah, it's the fastest,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.600
it's one of the fastest
cars you can possibly build.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.960
Yeah, so I guess my point
here with the whole video is,

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.920
yes, I still fully believe
electrification is the future

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.850
at every level of cars,
but in the meantime,

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:33.090
it's pretty clear that
hybrids make a lot of sense

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.910
and they've been right under
our noses the whole time.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:36.743
That's about it.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.219
I got your driver's speed deal.

00:14:40.219 --> 00:14:43.302
(light upbeat music)
